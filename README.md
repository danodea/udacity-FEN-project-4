# Website Optimization Project!

I was provided with a functional website that needed to be optimized.  I made the index.html score at least 90 on PageSpeedInsights, and I made the JavaScript in main.js run at 60fps!

## index.html Optimizations!

1. Use media query for separate print.css
2. Remove unnecesary CSS from the main CSS
3. Inline all CSS
4. Async all analytics JS
5. Host images locally
6. Optimize and resize images using [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/)
7. Remove web font and use default sans-serif font

## Pizza JS Optimizations!

1. Move anything that didn't need to be in the for loops to the outside of the loop!

## Using npm and Grunt!

I didn't use either for optimizing this project because I ended up inling most of the CSS (and also I didn't start playing with npm or Grunt until after I had gotten to the required PageScores and fps). I DID get them installed and working on a copy of this project.  Check out [my npm-tests repo](https://github.com/danodea/npm-tests.git) to see the results!
